For information on using antiviral drugs to treat influenza in hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients, see the CDC and IDSA recommendations. Credit: NIAID. Seasonal influenza, or flu, is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by any of several human influenza viruses that circulate globally and cause annual outbreaks of varying severity. Influenza viruses infect the nose, throat, and lungs and produce symptoms that include sudden fever, extreme fatigue, coughing, chills, and ... The prevention and treatment of influenza are best done with an interprofessional team that includes a nurse, nurse practitioner, primary care provider, internist, pharmacist, an emergency department physician, and an infectious disease specialist. Each year, the flu affects millions of people and lead to time off work and school. The prevention and treatment of influenza are with an interprofessional team that includes a nurse practitioner, primary care provider, internist, an emergency department physician, and an infectious disease specialist. The key is patient educations. All patients should be encouraged to get the annual flu vaccine that is available in November ... Another shortcoming in treating influenza virus infections is the requirement for in vivo disease models for influenza-related research, which can be challenging and problematic from the standpoint of evaluating antiviral treatment and efficacy.

If the lower respiratory tract specimen is also negative, antiviral treatment for influenza can be stopped. 4. Limitations of Antivirals and Anti-Influenza Drug-Resistance Mechanisms. Apart from these challenges, the emergence of drug-resistant influenza strains due to currently prescribed antiviral drug regimens is a major limitation in influenza treatment, and such related significant limitations of influenza monotherapy are detailed below. Give antiviral therapy for influenza within 48 hours of symptom onset (or earlier), and do not delay treatment for laboratory confirmation if a rapid test is not available. Antiviral treatment can provide benefit even after 48 hours in pregnant and other high-risk patients. Vaccination is the most effective method of preventing influenza illness. Influenza is a communicable viral disease that affects the upper and lower respiratory tract. A wide spectrum of influenza viruses causes it. Some of these viruses can infect humans, and some are specific to different species. These viruses are transmissible through respiratory droplets expelled from the mouth and respiratory system during coughing, talking, and sneezing. Influenza antivirals are divided into the following two categories of direct-acting drugs: neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (NAIs) that target the NA enzyme to prevent virus budding and the cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor, baloxavir marboxil. ...

The major challenge in treating influenza is the antiviral resistance of most human influenza A virus strains toward M2 inhibitors.
